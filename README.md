# Serving TensorFlow models with TensorFlow Serving :orange_book:

![TensorFlow Logo](https://inletlabs.com/assets/images/logo_stack/tensorflow-logo.png)

__TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, 
designed for production environments. TensorFlow Serving makes it easy to deploy new algorithms 
and experiments, while keeping the same server architecture and APIs. TensorFlow Serving 
provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to 
serve other types of models and data.__

Along this repository, the procedure so as to train and deploy a transfer learning CNN model using 
[ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) as backbone, which classifies images retrieved from a 
slice of a well known food dataset, named [Food101](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101).
